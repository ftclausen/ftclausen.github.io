In my shouting to the void on this blog I've mainly been writing about infra, development, and the intersection of the
two. However, for the last year, I've been bootstrapping my Mathematical knowledge for reading [Concrete
Mathematics](https://www.pearson.com.au/9780201558029); learning about topics as I encounter them to fully understand
what the book is conveying. I want to understand the mathematical underpinnings of computer science so I can write
simple, efficient, and maintainable code. Not only that, but what I've found over the last year, is that learning
mathematics has cultivated a clearer way of thinking about computing problems.

While working through the [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) Coursera course there
were some minor forays into Maths, e.g. telescoping series. While my mathematical understanding was imperfect I could
see the representation of the mathematical function in the code; which was magic. This has motivated me to learn more
about the mathematics underpinning of computer science.

On a personal level understanding the underlying CS mathematics will (and is starting to although early days) give me a
level of confidence in understanding and designing algorithms that I'd not get reading purely coding books. No doubt
it'll improve my programming interview skills far more than just reading something like _Cracking the Coding Interview_.

Finally, I've been enjoying this mathematical adventure much more than I expected. The more effort I put in (as much as
one can with a toddler at home haha) the more I enjoy it. I suspect I'll be doing mathematics for its own sake and
branching out from CS topics.
