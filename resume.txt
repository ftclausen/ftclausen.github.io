## What I Can Offer

I offer my skills and experience to help the organisation or client I am working
for achieve consistent systems, high availability and security. I enjoy working
at the intersection of Development and Operations; helping each department
understand the needs of the other and, at a technical level, creating tools and
processes to make it all actually work.

## Proficiency Summary

My proficiencies cover the following areas

* **Application Administration** - Supporting, primarily Java, web applications with regard to
provisioning, performance tuning and troubleshooting.
* **Infrastructure Code** - A combination of configuration management and tool
    development in various scripting languages to support 
    automated infrastructure and application management.
* **Systems Administration and Networking** - Managing, in as automated a way as possible, Linux 
    and Unix systems with regard to installation, ongoing maintenance and
    troubleshooting.  My Cisco studies have given me an understanding of networking
    theories and basic router and switch configuration. This allows me to see the
    greater context in which the systems and applications reside.
